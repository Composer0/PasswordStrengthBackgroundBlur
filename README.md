# PasswordStrengthBackgroundBlur
Background blur is decreased based on the length of the password. The JS code for this project is roughly 9 lines and operates through the use of a event listener that listens for the e.target.value of inputs inside of the password field. This feature only measures the length of the password in order to decrease or increase the blur of the background photo.
